> [!IMPORTANT]
> For moderation reasons, this mod requires [Silksong.ModList](https://github.com/silksong-modding/Silksong.ModList) to be installed. This mod is included in the [release download](<https://github.com/hk-speedrunning/Silksong.DebugMod/releases/latest>).
If Silksong.ModList is not installed, DebugMod will silently fail to load.

# Features

The mod is still in early development, and some features are missing or broken. These features are confirmed to work:

* Cheats such as infinite health and silk, noclip, and invincibility
* Change which skills the player has
* Increase or decrease health, silk, masks, spools, and needle damage
* Save and reload savestates
* View debug information about the game
* A toggleable overlay in-game through which to use the mod's features
* Configurable keybinds for most features
* Change the player's respawn point to anywhere in the current scene
* Recall to the set respawn point
* Kill all enemies
* Add HP bars to enemies
* Draw collision boxes for enemies
* Clone or delete any enemy
* Set an enemy's health to 9999
* Give unlimited rosaries and shell shards
* Damage the player anywhere/anytime
* Change the camera zoom level
* Disable the in game HUD
* Make the player invisible
* Disable the lighting around the player
* Disable the vignette drawn around the player
* Change the time scale of the game

We plan on adding any missing features from the Hollow Knight debug mod soon.

# Installation (Steam, Windows)

1) Download BepInEx from here: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/latest
1) Right click Silksong in Steam -> Properties -> Installed Files -> Browse...
1) Copy the contents of the BepInEx zip into this folder (overwrite files if asked)
1) Open and close the game once so BepInEx can generate its initial files
1) Download DebugMod and ModList from here: https://github.com/hk-speedrunning/Silksong.DebugMod/releases/latest
1) Copy the DebugMod and Silksong.ModList folders into `BepInEx/plugins` in the game folder (overwrite files if asked)
1) This mod should not affect saves negatively, but it is a good idea to back them up anyway.
